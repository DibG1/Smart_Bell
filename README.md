:bulb:**Problem Statement**

With the advent of lockdowns, gyms are required to be shut. This had led to a sizeable number of people purchasing gymming equipment for use at home. However, in the absence of a professional trainer, it's common for people to lift weights with improper form that can negatively affect their health.There have also been many cases of deaths in the gym due to cardiac arrests, especially during high intensity workout sessions.

Our product, the Smartbell capitalizes on this situation.To tackle the death due to cardiac arrest situation mentioned earlier, the smartbell has an alarm which rings when the BPM reaches unsafe levels. Our product is unique and better than a smart watch because it will not only alert the user about the increasing heartbeat but also help him/her in correcting their form ,number of reps performed and caories burnt. Its a highly specific device made only for excercising with free weights.
